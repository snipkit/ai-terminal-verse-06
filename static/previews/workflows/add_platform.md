# Configure your current NativeScript project to target the selected platform.

**Description:** Configures the current NativeScript project to target the selected platform. When you add a target platform, the NativeScript CLI creates a corresponding platform-specific subdirectory under the platforms directory. This platform-specific directory contains the necessary files to let you build your project for the target platform.
